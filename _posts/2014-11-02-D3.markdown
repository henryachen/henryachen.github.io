Recently, I discovered <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> a powerful Javascript library for creating beautiful and responsive data visualizations. 

It works seamlessly with existing web technologies can interact with all parts of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/" target="_blank">DOM</a> (document object model), and is as flexible as the client side web technology stack.

As a simple example, the chart at the bottom of the page uses spline interpolation with D3's built in <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes" target="_blank">axes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales" target="_blank">time scales</a> to visualize your scrolling and clicking activity during your time on this page.
