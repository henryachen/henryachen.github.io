Recently, I discovered [D3](http://d3js.org/) a powerful Javascript library for creating beautiful and responsive data visualizations. 

It works seamlessly with existing web technologies can interact with all parts of the [DOM](http://www.w3.org/DOM/) (document object model), and is as flexible as the client side web technology stack.

As a simple example, the chart at the bottom of the page uses spline interpolation with D3's built in [axes](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes) and [time scales](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Scales) to visualize your scrolling and clicking activity during your time on this page.
