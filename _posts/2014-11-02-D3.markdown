Recently, I discovered [D3](http://d3js.org/) a powerful Javascript library for creating beautiful and responsive data visualizations. It works seamlessly with existing web technologies can interact with all parts of the DOM (document object model), and is as flexible as the client side web technology stack.

As a simple example, the chart below uses spline interpolation with D3's built in and time scales to visualize your scrolling and clicking activity during your time on this page.
