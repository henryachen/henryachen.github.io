The accurate item and music recommendations of <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora.com</a> respectively, have always astounded me. Each system is unique -- tailored and optimized with different considerations in mind. In order to understand how these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system" target="_blank">recommendation systems</a> work, I decided build my own.


Using the dataset provided by the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/" target="_blank">Yelp Dataset Challenge</a>, I built a basic Recommendation System using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering" target="_blank">collaborative filtering</a>

This recommendation system is an ongoing project that will push me to dive deeper and build more sophisticated recommenders while sharpening my <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">python</a> skills.

Please feel free to take a look at the recommendation system I have built so far here: <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/henryachen/9d61ad38e10c4e43f1fb" target="_blank">Recommendation System</a>
