Hi! My name is Henry Chen and I am currently an undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley studying Chemistry with a materials science and engineering focus. 

I am a highly analytical, result-driven individual, and produce my best work in intellectually stimulating, fast-paced environments. My work in the physical sciences has allowed me developed a unique problem solving approach, one that I hope to use to efficiently solve complex problems without sacrificing quality.

It is a pleasure to meet you.

Cheers
